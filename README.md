By 2050 about 70 % of the world's population will live in cities. whilst global temperatures are rising towards +4°c, building facades are a main contributor to the urban heat island effect within cities. Increasing passive measures such as shading, reflectivity, thermal massing, adiabatic cooling can make strong contributions using our world resources more responsibly and make our cities more thermally resilient.

This research provides a proof of concept for a novel method of performing a regression task using convolutional neural networks to predict the solar irradiation value (kwh/m²) from images. Through synthetically generated data using ladybug for grasshopper in rhinoceros, around 30 datasets have been compiled for training two types of machine learning models - 1) TensorFlow/Keras CNN regression model and 2) ResNet50 pretrained model and tested on synthetic and real images. Image processing techniques using python’s library “openCV” have been applied on the images in order to measure the impact on the prediction, within each model.  
5 tests have been executed, iterating results from initially 20% accuracy till the final tests 97% accuracy for synthetic data prediction and 93% accuracy for real image prediction.  
This research aims to 
•        simplify the design-simulation-evaluation process, bringing radiation performance based design closer to the architecture practice and enabling more solar irradiation aware designs.
•        make a contribution to cooling down cities +  increase passive measures in architecture. 
•        contribute to a paradigm shift of ornaments in architecture from decoration to passive performance contributor. 
To create a technique  that  helps to provide an intuitive insight to climate  resilient design
